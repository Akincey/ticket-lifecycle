In this step, I used the Support Center portal to submit a ticket from the end-user perspective. I initially selected "Report a Problem" as the help topic but later escalated the ticket to "Business Critical" based on the severity and impact of the incident.

As referenced earlier, this screenshot shows me logged in as the agent I created. In this instance, I escalated the ticket titled "Business Critical Outage"—originally submitted under the help topic "Report a Problem"—to "Business Critical" due to the severity of the issue.

The issue summary reads:
"My employees are reporting that users are no longer able to access the online banking portal. Those who can access it intermittently are unable to log in."

This is another support ticket I created and resolved. The request came from the Accounting department, which required an Adobe software upgrade. After initiating the upgrade and advising the client to restart their computer, the issue was successfully resolved. The ticket was then documented and marked as closed.
